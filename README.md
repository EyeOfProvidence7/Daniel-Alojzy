# Daniel-Alojzy
In the beginning, there were 5 lord souls taken from the First Flame. Ooqynq Zhodhxigh, was the finder of the 5th lord soul, aquiring the power of wisdom and intelligence, and becoming a natural philosopher. He retreated away, not partaking in the battle between the Gods and Everlasting Dragons. He was only on one mission - ascend to a level beyond the gods. Unbeknownst to the other gods, he sought to increase his power level beyond the limits imposed by reality, and he foolishly decided that dividing by zero is the answer. If he could control the massive space-ripple that would be created, he would become omnipotent across space and time. 

Against all possibilities and universal barriers, Ooqynq finally was able to divide by zero using the existing power of his lord soul, but the consequences were unforseen - if this event was to continue, space and time itself will be destroyed... reason itself would be decimated... but the event already started unfolding, and as a last resort, nature could only do one thing to protect existence itself... by re-writing history.  As a consequence, the existence of the 5th lord soul was eradicated. But you cannot take things away without replacing it with something else... balance must be restored to the universe, and thus Daniel Alojzy arose from the First Flame, a manifestation of the lost energy, restoring balance. Within his soul lies all the energy that Dividing by Zero has created, and is locked away by a powerful seal etched on his face by nature itself.

His mission is to become the most powerful warrior Lordran has ever laid eyes upon, and then find a way to break the seal on his face. If he is successful in breaking the seal and and if he is strong enough to control the astronomical energy surge, he will become space and time itself. His very being will resonate with every subatomic particle in the universe and have complete control over all micro and macroscopic events in all time and dimensions, and warp definitions of reality itself. He will not cease until he prevails over existence. His creators' vision will soon be realised.
